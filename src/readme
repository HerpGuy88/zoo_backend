#Requirements:
Node ~22.15
NPM ~11.3.0
PostGreSQL ~14.1 running locally

#To Install:

1. Download the Source Code
   Unzip the provided archive (which can also be downloaded from GitHub)
   OR
   Clone the GitHub repository to your workspace.

2. On your local PostGreSQL instance, create an empty database named "animal_behavior".

   ```
   psql
   init db animal_behavior
   ```

3. Create a file named ".env" in the root directory of the project. Paste the following into the file, then replace the curly brackets {} and the text between them with the name of your local postgres username and password, respectively (the username is often "postgres", and the password may not be required):

   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://{YOUR POSTGRES USERNAME}:{YOUR POSTGRES PASSWORD}@localhost:5432/animal_behavior?schema=public"
   NODE_ENV="development"
   PORT = 3000
   ```

4. Now connect the server to your local instance of the database, perform a database migration, and seed the new database by running the following commands from the root directory of the project:

   ```
   npx prisma db push
   npx prisma db seed
   ```

5. Everything should be ready to go now. To start the server run the following command from the root directory of your project:

   ```
   npm run dev

   ```

6. Now that the backend is up and running, install the frontend by following the README file incluced in the frontend repository.
